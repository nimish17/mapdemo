Android Location Demo

What is Android location-aware application?

They are the apps that use device’s GPS to determine a user’s physical location.

But, how does it actually works? How it helps to get the data of user’s current location?

To do that, you need to integrate the Android Location API in your native Android app. And I’m guessing You’re here because you’re also working on some project or building your own app and want to integrate this feature. 

I had the same problem while I was working on a project at Space-O Technologies, which is a leading [mobile app development company] (http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/mobile-app-development/) and I’ve learnt the best solution for this.

I’ve also written [a step-by-step guide] (https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/develop-android-location-aware-applications-location-tracking/) for you to understand the exact process of integrating Android Location API with one demo.
